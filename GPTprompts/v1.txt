Write a program in PowerShell. The goal is to help me update my budget by reading expenses from csv files, ignoring duplicates, and populating my budget spreadsheet.

2023Budget.xlsx is my budget spreadsheet. It has 12 tabs for the 12 months (month names are Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec). Each of those months has a table in it (columns s-w starting on row 8) where the month's expenses are listed.

rewards.csv and checking.csv are my csv exports from my two bank accounts. 

Each time I run the PowerShell script, compare each expense from rewards.csv and checking.csv to the existing list of expenses in 2023Budget.xlsx for only the current month and previous month. If the dollar amount and the date are the same as an existing expense in 2023Budget.xlsx for the given month, consider it a duplicate and don't add it. If it's not a duplicate, append it to the bottom of the expenses table on the correct month.


The xlsx columns (starting on row 8):
Column s is the date of the expense. Format is mm/dd/yy.
Column t is the item.
Column u is the method. If the expense is from rewards.csv, method is Rewards. If the expense is from checking.csv, method is Checking.
Column v should be left blank.
Column w is the dollar amount.

The csv columns:
Column a can be ignored.
Column b is the date of the expense. Format is mm/dd/yyyy. Should be used to compare and identify duplicates. If it's not a duplicate should be copied into column s of the xlsx.
column c should be ignored.
column d is the description. Should be copied into column t of 2023Budget.xlsx (if the expense isn't a duplicate).
Column e is the dollar amount. Should be used to compare and identify duplicates. Should be copied into column w of 2023Budget.xlsx (if the expense isn't a duplicate).
Column f is credit. If this column has something in it, discard the expense.
Columns g, h, and i should be ignored.

Let me know if you need me to provide any additional information.
