Write a program in PowerShell. The goal is to help me update my budget by reading expenses from csv files, ignoring duplicates, and populating my budget spreadsheet.

C:\PersonalMyCode\UpdateBudget\oldBudgetData.csv is the existing expenses that have been recorded.
C:\PersonalMyCode\UpdateBudget\bankData.csv is my csv export from my bank account. 
C:\PersonalMyCode\UpdateBudget\output.csv is where the data will be exported.

Each time I run the PowerShell script, compare each expense from bankData.csv to the existing list of expenses in oldBudgetData.csv. If the bankData.csv Post Data and Debit columns match the Date and Amount columns of oldBudgetData.csv respectively consider it a duplicate and don't add it. If it's not a duplicate, it should be added to output.csv.

For example, when I run it on the following csvs, I should have only the following results in output.csv Since they're the only ones in bankData.csv that aren't in oldBudgetData.csv.

4/1/2023,1
4/5/2023,7
